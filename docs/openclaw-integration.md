# OpenClaw Integration

MedgeClaw runs on top of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). This guide explains how to inject MedgeClaw's identity, skills, and project context into an OpenClaw instance.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd /path/to/MedgeClaw
bash medgeclaw-init.sh
openclaw gateway restart
```

## What `medgeclaw-init.sh` Does

1. **Skills path** — Adds `MedgeClaw/skills/` to `openclaw.json` → `skills.load.extraDirs`, making `biomed-dispatch` and `cjk-viz` skills available to the agent.

2. **MEDGECLAW.md** — Writes a project context file to the OpenClaw workspace (`~/.openclaw/workspace/MEDGECLAW.md`). This file is loaded every session, giving the agent awareness of MedgeClaw's project structure, execution environment, and core rules.

3. **IDENTITY.md** — Updates the agent's identity to "MedgeClaw 🧬🦀".

4. **SOUL.md** — Appends a MedgeClaw-specific personality section (proactively consult K-Dense skills, use Chinese labels, rigorous statistics, etc.).

5. **AGENTS.md** — Adds an instruction to read `MEDGECLAW.md` on every session startup.

6. **BOOTSTRAP.md** — Removes the bootstrap file if present (no longer needed after init).

## Recovery: `medgeclaw-remind.sh`

If OpenClaw gets accidentally reset or a new session loses context:

```bash
bash /path/to/MedgeClaw/medgeclaw-remind.sh
```

This script:
- Checks if `MEDGECLAW.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, and skills config are intact
- If anything is missing, runs the full `medgeclaw-init.sh` automatically
- If everything is fine, sends a system event to remind the agent of its MedgeClaw identity

## Manual Configuration

If you prefer not to use the scripts, add this to your `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "load": {
      "extraDirs": [
        "/path/to/MedgeClaw/skills"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Then copy `MEDGECLAW.md` (generated by the init script) to `~/.openclaw/workspace/`.
