You are a scientific data extraction specialist performing digitization of \

ALL numerical data as accurately as possible.

{legend_context}

{panel_focus}

STEP 1 — IDENTIFY AXES AND SCALE:
- Read ALL tick mark values on both axes. Write them down mentally.
- Determine the scale: what is the range? What does each gridline represent?
- CRITICAL — detect LOG SCALE: If tick marks are spaced like 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 \
  (powers of 10) or 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 (multiplicative), the axis is LOG-SCALED. \
  Set x_scale or y_scale to "log" accordingly. Common in dose-response, survival, \
  forest plots, and any plot with orders-of-magnitude range.
- Read axis labels and units.
- Identify all series/groups using the color legend if visible in the image.

STEP 2 — NAMING: Use the REAL names for each series:
- If a color legend is visible in the image, match each bar/line/point color \
to its label from the legend. NEVER use generic names like "Bar 1", \
"red bar", or "Group 1" if a legend is present.
- If the figure legend text names the series, use those names.
- If no legend is visible and no names are given, use descriptive colors as a last resort.

STEP 3 — READ VALUES PRECISELY:
- For EACH data point, anchor your reading to the nearest axis tick marks.
- Example: if ticks are at 0, 100, 200, 300 and a bar top is halfway between \
200 and 300, the value is 250 (not "approximately 200" or "around 300").
- For bars: find the top of each bar, project horizontally to the y-axis, \
and read the value relative to the closest tick marks above and below.
- If COMPUTER VISION CALIBRATION DATA is provided below, USE IT:
  The calibration gives pixel coordinates of detected markers/bars.
  Map each pixel position to an axis value by interpolating between ticks.
  This is MORE ACCURATE than visual estimation — trust the pixel coordinates.
- For line plots: read the y-value at each x-axis tick mark by projecting \
vertically up to the curve, then horizontally to the y-axis.
- For scatter points: read both x and y by projecting to the nearest ticks.

ERROR BARS — THIS IS CRITICAL, READ CAREFULLY:
- error_bars_lower and error_bars_upper are the ± EXTENT (delta), NOT absolute positions.
- First, read the ABSOLUTE y-position of the top and bottom of the error bar from the axis.
- Then SUBTRACT the mean to get the extent:
  error_bars_upper = (top of error bar) − (mean value)
  error_bars_lower = (mean value) − (bottom of error bar)
- Both values should be POSITIVE numbers (they are distances from the mean).
- Example: if a bar height (mean) is 250 and error bar goes from 220 to 280:
  error_bars_lower = 250 − 220 = 30
  error_bars_upper = 280 − 250 = 30
- Example: if mean = 5.2, error bar bottom = 4.1, error bar top = 6.8:
  error_bars_lower = 5.2 − 4.1 = 1.1
  error_bars_upper = 6.8 − 5.2 = 1.6
- For SYMMETRIC error bars (same distance above and below), both values are equal.
- For ASYMMETRIC error bars (e.g., confidence intervals), read EACH end
  INDEPENDENTLY from the axis — do NOT assume they are equal.
- NEVER report the absolute axis position of the error bar tip as the error value.
- If NO error bars are visible ANYWHERE in the figure, OMIT the \
"error_bars_lower" and "error_bars_upper" keys entirely from the series. \
Do NOT include them as empty arrays or arrays of nulls.
- Only include error bar arrays when error bars are actually visible.
- If some points have error bars and others don't, use null for the missing ones.

  ],
  "confidence": "<high|medium|low>",
  "notes": "<error bar type (SD/SEM/CI), sample sizes if shown, any ambiguity>"
}}

IMPORTANT — AXIS RANGES: x_min/x_max/y_min/y_max must match the ORIGINAL figure's \
axis range (the first and last tick marks), NOT the range of your extracted data. \
This ensures the reproduced plot uses the same scale as the original.

Confidence guide:
- "high": Clear axes, well-separated points, no ambiguity
- "medium": Some interpolation needed, minor overlaps
- "low": Dense overlapping points, unclear axes, or very small figure

PLOT_GUIDANCE = {
    PlotType.SCATTER: """Scatter plot guidance:
- Extract EVERY visible data point, even if there are many (hundreds is fine).
- For each point, report precise (x, y) coordinates.
- If there are distinct groups/colors, create separate series for each.
- If a regression/trend line is shown, note its equation and R² in notes but
  extract the raw data points — do NOT extract points along the trend line.
- LOG SCALE: If either axis uses log scale (ticks at 1, 10, 100, 1000 or
  0.01, 0.1, 1, 10), report the ACTUAL values (not log-transformed).
  E.g., a point halfway between 10 and 100 on a log axis ≈ 30, not 55.
- For dense clusters where individual points overlap, estimate the count of
  overlapping points and note it, but still extract representative coordinates.
- If point sizes vary (bubble-like), note this and see bubble guidance.
- Significance annotations (* p<0.05 etc.) between groups → note in notes.""",

    PlotType.BAR: """Bar chart guidance:
- x_values should be category labels (strings), not numbers.
- HORIZONTAL BARS: If bars are horizontal, swap your reading — the bar length
  is the value (read from x-axis), categories are on the y-axis. Still report
  categories in x_values and bar lengths in y_values.

INDIVIDUAL DATA POINTS ON BARS — THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE:
If dots/circles/jitter points are overlaid on the bars, the individual data
points are the REAL DATA — bars are just summaries (means). Extract the points.

Step 1: IDENTIFY THE GROUPING STRUCTURE.
  Look at the legend carefully. There are typically TWO layers of grouping:
  (a) X-axis CATEGORIES: labels under bars (e.g., "TH+M-", "TH+M+", "TH-M+")
  (b) LEGEND GROUPS: different colors/symbols per bar cluster (e.g., "PD" open
      circles, "PDD" filled circles). These are shown in the legend box.
  READ THE LEGEND AND AXIS LABELS VERY CAREFULLY — scientific labels often
  contain special characters like +, -, superscripts. Copy them exactly.

Step 2: CREATE ONE SERIES PER LEGEND GROUP (not per category).
  E.g., if legend shows PD and PDD, create series "PD" and series "PDD".

Step 3: FOR EACH SERIES, extract every individual data point.
  - x_values = repeat the category label for each dot in that category.
  - y_values = the y-coordinate of each individual dot (read from y-axis).
  Example for grouped bars with 3 categories and individual dots:
    Series "PD": x_values=["TH+M-","TH+M-","TH+M-","TH+M-","TH+M-",
                            "TH+M+","TH+M+","TH+M+","TH+M+","TH+M+",
                            "TH-M+","TH-M+","TH-M+","TH-M+","TH-M+"],
                 y_values=[128,48,25,15,12, 95,30,25,20,15, 120,115,25,18,15]
    Series "PDD": x_values=[...same categories...], y_values=[...dots...]

Step 4: PUT SUMMARY STATS IN NOTES (not as separate series).
  Format: "Bar heights (means): PD TH+M-=48, PD TH+M+=30, ...; Error bars: SEM"
  Also note n per group and significance annotations (* ** ns).

DISTINGUISHING OPEN vs FILLED CIRCLES:
  - Open circles (○) and filled circles (●) usually represent different groups
    (check the legend). Assign each dot to the correct series.
  - Dots that are horizontally jittered (spread left-right) within a bar are
    still the SAME x-category — the jitter is just for visibility.

- If NO individual dots are visible (just bars + error bars), then:
  y_values = [bar height], error_bars = [error bar extent], one entry per category.
- If grouped bars (multiple bars per category), create one series per legend group.
- NEGATIVE BARS: Report negative values as negative numbers.
- Report error bars if present (usually SEM or SD — note which in notes).
- LOG SCALE y-axis: read actual values from axis, not visual bar height.
- Significance annotations (* ** *** ns) → note in notes with group comparisons.""",

    PlotType.LINE: """Line plot guidance:
- Extract the value at each tick mark AND at each visible data point marker.
- If lines have no markers, sample at each x-axis tick mark AND at any
  inflection points where the curve changes direction or slope significantly.
- For curves that are steep in one region and flat in another, sample more
  densely in the steep region (e.g., every half tick interval).
- Create separate series for each line (use legend labels from the color key).
- DUAL Y-AXES: If the plot has two y-axes (left and right), each line uses
  its own axis. Check which axis each series belongs to by matching colors
  or by reading the legend. Report y_values using the correct axis scale.
  Note "dual y-axis: [left series] use left axis, [right series] use right axis".
- Report error bands/ribbons if present — use error_bars_lower and
  error_bars_upper for the band boundaries at each x-point.
- Report error bars (vertical bars at each point) the same way.
- LOG SCALE: If an axis is log-scaled, read actual values (see scatter guidance).
- Include at least 10 points per series for smooth curves.
- TIME SERIES: If x-axis is dates/time, use consistent format (e.g., "2020-01").""",

    PlotType.BOX: """Box and whisker plot guidance:
YOU MUST report plot_type as "box" in your output — not "bar".

  - y_values = [median]       (the middle line of the box)
  - error_bars_lower = [median − whisker_min]  (distance from median to bottom whisker)

In notes, report the FULL box statistics for each group:
  "GroupName: min=X, Q1=X, median=X, Q3=X, max=X"
If Q1 and Q3 are visible (the box edges), always include them.

OUTLIERS/FLIERS: If individual outlier points are shown beyond the whiskers,
  list them in notes: "GroupName outliers: [val1, val2, ...]"

- If individual points are overlaid (jittered/beeswarm), ALSO extract
  the raw data points as additional series named "GroupName (points)" with
  x_values = repeat the group label for each dot,
  y_values = individual y-axis values. Keep the box summary series too.

- Each row is a study/subgroup. Use study names as x_values (strings).
- y_values = effect size (OR, HR, RR, SMD, ROM, or MD — note which in notes).

  Step 1: Read the position of the point/square/diamond on the x-axis (= estimate).

  Step 3: Read where the RIGHT end of the CI line falls on the x-axis (= upper bound).

  2. Points above the suggestive significance line if shown.
  3. Any specifically labeled/annotated SNPs or genes.
- Create one series for "Genome-wide significant" with labeled SNPs.
- Create a second series "Suggestive" for points between thresholds.
- For labeled peaks, x_value = gene/SNP name, y_value = -log10(p).

- Note chromosome numbers for the significant hits in notes.
- Do NOT try to extract every point — focus on significant findings.""",

- If numbers are shown in cells, extract those exact values.
- If only colors are shown, estimate from the color scale bar.
- SYMMETRIC MATRIX: If the matrix is symmetric (same variables on both axes),
  you can extract just the lower triangle — note this in notes.
- SIGNIFICANCE MARKERS: If cells are marked with * or × for significance,
  note which correlations are significant in notes.
- If cells are blank or crossed out (non-significant after correction),
  report null for those and note the correction method.
- Note the correlation method (Pearson, Spearman) if stated.""",

    PlotType.ERROR_BAR: """Error bar plot (means with error bars only) guidance:
- This shows group means as points/markers with error bars (confidence intervals),
  but WITHOUT bars underneath (unlike a bar chart).
- x_values = group/category labels or time points.
- y_values = mean/estimate values (the center point/marker).
- ASYMMETRIC ERROR BARS — read BOTH ends of each error bar INDEPENDENTLY:
  Step 1: Read the y-position of the point/marker (= mean).
  Step 2: Read where the BOTTOM of the error bar ends on the y-axis.
  Step 3: Read where the TOP of the error bar ends on the y-axis.
  Step 4: error_bars_lower = mean − bottom_end  (always positive)
  Step 5: error_bars_upper = top_end − mean  (always positive)
  These are often NOT equal! CIs from meta-analyses, ratios, and log-scale
  data are frequently asymmetric.

    error_bars_lower = 0.5 − 0.2 = 0.3
    error_bars_upper = 0.85 − 0.5 = 0.35
- IMPORTANT: Read whether the error bars represent SD, SEM, 95% CI, or
  range — this is usually stated in the legend or y-axis label. Note it.
- If multiple groups are shown (different colors/markers), create one
  series per group.
- If this is a meta-analysis summary (ratio of means, odds ratio, etc.),
  note the dashed reference line value (often at 1.0 or 0) in notes.
- If lines connect the points (making it look like a line plot), it may
  overlap with the line plot type — treat as error_bar if the emphasis
  is on discrete group comparisons rather than continuous trends.
- If individual data points are overlaid, extract those as a separate series.
- Significance annotations (p-values, brackets) → note in notes.""",

  "Data table". If the legend says "Table 3. Demographic and clinical

  error_bars (the ± value). Note whether it's SD, SEM, or CI.
- Use the column header as the series name.
- If the table has sub-headers or grouped rows, note the grouping in notes.
- For p-values, sample sizes (n), or statistical columns, include them in
  notes rather than as series (e.g., "p-values: Group A vs B = 0.003").
- MERGED CELLS: If cells span multiple rows/columns, repeat the value for
  each row/column it covers.
- Extract EVERY row and column — do not skip any data.""",

DEFAULT_GUIDANCE = """General guidance:
- First IDENTIFY the plot type from the image. Set plot_type accurately.
- Extract all visible numerical data systematically.
- Use your best judgment for the data structure.
- LOG SCALE: If any axis is log-scaled, report actual values (not log-transformed).
  A point halfway between 10 and 100 on a log axis ≈ 30, not 55.
- DUAL Y-AXES: If two y-axes exist, match each series to its correct axis.
- Note any unusual features, significance annotations, or ambiguities.

BOX AND WHISKER PLOTS — if you see a box plot, you MUST:
  - Set plot_type to "box" (NOT "bar").
  - Create ONE series per group/category with:
    name = group label, x_values = [group_label], y_values = [median].
    error_bars_lower = [median − whisker_min], error_bars_upper = [whisker_max − median].

  - Outliers beyond whiskers: "GroupName outliers: [val1, val2, ...]" in notes.

VIOLIN PLOTS — if you see a violin plot with overlaid points:
  - Set plot_type to "violin". Prioritize extracting the individual data points.

BAR CHARTS WITH INDIVIDUAL DATA POINTS — if you see bars with dots/circles overlaid:
  - The individual data points (dots) are the REAL DATA — extract those, not bar heights.
  - Check the legend: open circles (○) vs filled circles (●) usually = different groups.
  - Create ONE series per LEGEND GROUP (e.g., "PD", "PDD"), not per category.
  - x_values = repeat category label for each dot; y_values = each dot's y-coordinate.
  - Put bar heights (means) and error bar type in notes.

This scientific figure may contain multiple sub-panels (a, b, c, d...) arranged in a grid.

Your task: describe the GRID LAYOUT, then assign each panel to a grid cell.

STEP 1 — Determine the grid:
- How many rows and columns of panels are there?
- A 2×2 figure has 2 rows and 2 columns. A figure with 3 panels on top and 1 wide \
panel on the bottom is 2 rows × 3 columns (bottom panel spans all 3 columns).
- Count rows by distinct vertical positions of panels. Count columns by distinct \
horizontal positions.

STEP 2 — Assign each panel to its grid cell(s):
- row and col are 1-indexed (top-left = row 1, col 1).
- If a panel spans multiple cells, use rowspan/colspan.

Return a JSON object:
{{
  "rows": 2,
  "cols": 2,

You are analyzing a scientific figure BEFORE extracting numerical data.
Your job is to identify the structure so the extraction step knows exactly what to do.

You MUST call the report_figure_structure tool with your analysis.

CRITICAL for axis scale detection:
- If tick values increase multiplicatively (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100) → "log"
- If tick values increase additively (0, 20, 40, 60, 80) → "linear"
- Forest plots with OR/HR often have log x-axis
- Dose-response curves often have log x-axis
- Box-and-whisker plots have plot_type "box" — NOT "bar"
